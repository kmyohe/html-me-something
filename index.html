        <p class= "tab">It started with an offer from my dad to go to Oktoberfest in Munich
        one more time. He wanted everyone in the family to go, but unfortunately that
        is not what endded up happening.</p>
        <p class="tab">In Ireland we stayed in Dublin next to the Guinness Brewery. We took two day tours with a bus company where we got to see the Giants Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, and the Cliffs of Moher.
        In Germany we went to Munich specifically for Oktoberfest. Denise and I bought Dirndls and drank a liter of beer at a time, which in hindsight is too much beer. A mistake I will be sure to make again.
        Next we went to Salzburg, Austria. It was beautiful there even though we only spent a day there. We went to Salzburg castle in that one day and another brewery. The next day we took a train back to Germany then a flight to our next destination, England.
        In England we stayed in London. We rode the Eye of London together and while Denise and I took the Harry Potter studio Tour, Pat and Matt did the Tower or Terror. There was so much more we did on this trip but these were the highlights and the things I remember the most.<br></p>
        <p class="tab">The second trip I took was with my mom, Denise and Pat. We took a cruise to the Bahamas for my mom’s birthday. It was a five day cruise of utter relaxation and it was beautiful. If I ever got the chance to I would take that trip again.
        There were three days of cruising and two days at different islands. The first Island was Nassau where we got the chance to snorkel and did a walking beer tour. The tour was a lot of fun because they talked a lot about the Pirates who would come to Nassau.
        The second island was Coco Cay. We also went snorkeling at this island and I must say I liked it more here. The water was clearer and there were more fish. We also road Jet skis which was something I had never done before. We all also got stung by jellyfish so that was a new experience too, although not a great one.<br>
        Overall these two trips were so much fun and I am so glad I got to do them with my family. I hope someday I will be able to go to Oktoberfest in Munich again. I also hope that one day I’ll be able to go on another cruise. But if it came down to it and I had to choose, I would go to Europe over a cruise.<br></p>
